This program is designed to make it easy for people to sort \& rank their favorite songs, artists, and albums. It will accomplish this by first getting a list of songs from the user and then presenting to the user a pair of songs and having them choose which one of the two they like more. The program will then continue to present pairs of songs to the user until each song is sorted.
